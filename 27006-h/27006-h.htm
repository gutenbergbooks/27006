<h2>Notes.</h2>

<h3>Notes on Midland County Minstrelsy.</h3>

  <p>It has often occurred to me that the old country folk-songs are as
  worthy of a niche in your mausoleum as the more prosy lore to which you
  allot a separate division. Why does not some one write a Minstrelsy of
  the Midland Counties? There is ample material to work upon, and not yet
  spoiled by dry-as-dust-ism. It would be vain, perhaps, to emulate the
  achievements of the Scottish antiquary; but surely something might be
  done better than the county <i>Garlands</i>, which, with a few honorable
  exceptions, are sad abortions, mere channels for rhyme-struck editors.
  There is one peculiarity of the midland songs and ballads which I do not
  remember to have seen noticed, viz. their singular affinity to those of
  Scotland, as exhibited in the collections of Scott and Motherwell. I have
  repeatedly noticed this, even so far south as Gloucestershire. Of the old
  Staffordshire ballad which appeared in your columns some months ago, I
  remember to have heard two distinct versions in Warwickshire, all
  approaching more or less to the Scottish type:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Hame came our gude man at e'en."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Now whence this curious similarity in the vernacular ideology of
  districts so remote? Are all the versions from one original, distributed
  by the wandering minstrels, and in course of time adapted to new
  localities and dialects? and, if so, whence came the original, from
  England or Scotland? Here is a nut for <span class="sc">Dr.
  Rimbault</span>, or some of your other correspondents learned in popular
  poetry. Another instance also occurs to me. Most of your readers are
  doubtless familiar with the pretty little ballad of "Lady Anne" in the
  <i>Border Minstrelsy</i>, which relates so plaintively the murder of the
  two innocent babes, and the ghostly retribution to the guilty mother.
  Other versions are given by Kinloch in his <i>Ancient Scottish
  Ballads</i>, and by Buchan in the <i>Songs of the North</i>, the former
  laying the scene in London:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"There lived a ladye in London,</p>
      <p class="i1">All alone and alonie,</p>
      <p>She's gane wi' bairn to the clerk's son,</p>
      <p class="i1">Down by the green-wood side sae bonny."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
<p><!-- Page 358 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page358"></a>{358}</span></p>

  <p>And the latter across the Atlantic:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"The minister's daughter of New York,</p>
      <p class="i1">Hey with the rose and the Lindie, O,</p>
      <p>Has fa'en in love wi' her father's clerk,</p>
      <p class="i1">A' by the green burn sidie, O."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>A Warwickshire version, on the contrary, places the scene on our own
  "native leas:"</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"There was a lady lived on lea,</p>
      <p class="i1">All alone, alone O,</p>
      <p>Down the greenwood side went she,</p>
      <p class="i1">Down the greenwood side, O.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"She set her foot all on a thorn<a name="footnotetag1" href="#footnote1"><sup>[1]</sup></a>,</p>
      <p class="i1">Down the greenwood side, O,</p>
      <p>There she had two babies born,</p>
      <p class="i1">All alone, alone O.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"O she had nothing to lap them in,</p>
      <p class="i1">All alone, alone O,</p>
      <p>But a white appurn and that was thin,</p>
      <p class="i1">Down the greenwood side, O," &amp;c.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Here there are no less than four versions of the same ballad, each
  differing materially from the other, but all bearing unmistakeable marks
  of a common origin. It would be interesting to know the process by which
  this was managed.</p>

  <p class="author"><span class="sc">C. Clifton Barry.</span></p>

<div class="note">
  <a name="footnote1"></a><b>Footnote 1:</b><a
  href="#footnotetag1">(return)</a>
  <p>In one of the Scottish ballads the same idea is more prettily
  expressed "leaned until a brier."</p>

<h3>COMET SUPERSTITIONS IN 1853.</h3>

  <p>From the 19th of August to the present time that brilliant comet,
  which was first seen by M. Klinkerfues, at Göttingen, on the 10th of June
  last, has been distinctly visible here, and among the ignorant classes
  its appearance has caused no little alarm. The reason of this we shall
  briefly explain.</p>

  <p>During the past fifty-five years the Maltese have grievously suffered
  on three different occasions; firstly, by the revolution of 1798, which
  was followed by the plague in 1813; and lastly, by the cholera in 1837.
  In these visitations, all of which are in the recollection of the oldest
  inhabitants, thirty thousand persons are supposed to have perished.</p>

  <p>Mindful as these aged people are of these sad bereavements, and
  declaring as they do that they were all preceded by some "curious signs"
  in the heavens which foretold their approach, men's minds have become
  excited, and, reason as one may, still the impression now existing that
  some fatal harm is shortly to follow will not be removed.</p>

  <p>A few of the inhabitants, more terrified than their neighbours, have
  fancied the comet's tail to be a fiery sword, and therefore predict a
  general war in Europe, and consequent fall of the Ottoman Empire. But as
  this statement is evidently erroneous, we still live in great hopes,
  notwithstanding all previous predictions and "curious signs," that the
  comet will pass away without bringing in its train any grievous
  calamity.</p>

  <p>By the following extracts, taken from some leading journals of the
  day, it will be seen that the Maltese are not alone in entertaining a
  superstitious dread of a comet's appearance. The Americans, Prussians,
  Spaniards, and Turks come in the same list, which perhaps may be
  increased by your correspondents:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"The Madrid journals announce that the appearance of the comet has
  excited great alarm in that city, as it is considered a symptom of divine
  wrath, and a presage of war, pestilence, and affliction for
  humanity."&mdash;Vide <i>Galignani's Messenger</i> of August 31,
  1853.</p>

  <p>"The entire appearance (of the comet) is brilliant and dazzling; and
  while it engrosses the attention and investigation of the scientific, it
  excites the alarm of the superstitious, who, as in ancient times, regard
  it as the concomitant of pestilence and the herald of war."&mdash;Vide
  New York correspondence of <i>The Sun</i>, Aug. 24, 1853.</p>

  <p>"The splendid comet now visible after sun-set on the western horizon,
  has attracted the attention of every body here. The public impression is,
  that this celestial phenomenon is to be considered as a sign of war; and
  their astrologers, to whom appeal is made for an interpretation, make the
  most absurd declarations: and I have been laughed at by very intelligent
  Turks, when I ventured to persuade them that great Nature's laws do not
  care about troubles here below."&mdash;Vide Turkish correspondence of
  <i>The Herald</i>, Aug. 25, 1853.</p>

  <p>"The comet which has lately been visible has served a priest not far
  from Warsaw with materials for a very curious sermon. After having
  summoned his congregation together, although it was neither Sunday nor
  festival, and shown them the comet, he informed them that this was the
  same star that had appeared to the Magi at the birth of our Saviour, and
  that it was only visible now in the Russian empire. Its appearance on
  this occasion was to intimate to the Russian eagle, that the time was now
  come for it to spread out its wings, and embrace all mankind in one
  orthodox and sanctifying church. He showed them the star now standing
  immediately over Constantinople, and explained that the dull light of the
  nucleus indicated its sorrow at the delay of the Russian army in
  proceeding to its destination."&mdash;Vide Berlin correspondence of

<h3>THE OLD ENGLISH WORD "BELIKE."</h3>

  <p>The word <i>belike</i>, much used by old writers, but now almost
  obsolete, even among the poor, seems to have been but very imperfectly
  understood&mdash;as far as regards its original meaning and derivation.
  Most persons understand it to be equivalent, or nearly so, to <i>very
  likely</i>, <i>in all likelihood</i>, <i>perhaps</i>, or, ironically,
  <i>forsooth</i>; and in that <!-- Page 359 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page359"></a>{359}</span>opinion they are not far wrong. It occurs
  in this sense in numerous passages in Shakspeare; for instance:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Some merry mocking lord, <i>belike</i>."&mdash;<i>Love's Labour's Lost.</i></p>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"O then, <i>belike</i>, she was old and gentle."&mdash;<i>Henry V.</i></p>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"<i>Belike</i>, this show imports the argument."&mdash;<i>Hamlet.</i></p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Such also was Johnson's opinion of the word, for he represents it to
  be "from <i>like</i>, as by <i>likelihood</i>;" and assigns to it the
  meanings of "probably, likely, perhaps." However, I venture to say, in
  opposition to so great an authority, that there is no immediate connexion
  whatever between the words <i>belike</i> and <i>likely</i>, with the
  exception of the accidental similarity in the syllable <i>like</i>.</p>

  <p>We find three different meanings attached to the same form <i>like</i>
  in English, viz. <i>like</i>, similis; <i>to like</i>, i. e. to be
  pleased with; and the present word <i>belike</i>, whose real meaning I
  propose to explain.</p>

  <p>The first is from the A.-S. <i>lic</i>, <i>gelic</i>; Low Germ.
  <i>lick</i>; Dutch <i>gelyk</i>; Dan. <i>lig</i> (which is said to take
  its meaning <span class="correction" title="Original reads `form'."
  >from</span> <i>lic</i>, a corpse, <i>i. e.</i> an essence), which word
  also forms our English termination -<i>ly</i>, sometimes preserving its
  old form <i>like</i>; as <i>manly</i> or <i>manlike</i>, <i>Godly</i> or
  <i>Godlike</i>; A.-S. <i>werlic</i>, <i>Godlic</i>; to which the Teut.
  adjectival termination <i>lich</i> is analogous.</p>

  <p>The second form, <i>to like</i>, i. e. to be pleased with, is quite
  distinct from the former (though it has been thought akin to it on the
  ground that <i>simili similis placet</i>); and is derived from the A.-S.
  <i>lician</i>, which is from <i>lic</i>, or <i>lac</i>, a gift; Low Germ.
  <i>licon</i>; Dutch <i>lyken</i>.</p>

  <p>The third form, the compound term <i>belike</i> (mostly used
  adverbially) is from the A.-S. <i>licgan</i>, <i>belicgan</i>, which
  means, to lie by, near, or around; to attend, accompany; Low Germ. and
  Dutch, <i>liggen</i>; Germ. <i>liegen</i>. In the old German, we have
  <i>licken</i>, <i>ligin</i>, <i>liggen</i>&mdash;<i>jacere</i>; and
  <i>geliggen</i>&mdash;<i>se habere</i>; which last seems to be the exact
  counterpart of our old English <i>belike</i>; and this it was which first
  suggested to me what I conceive to be its true meaning. We find the
  simple and compound words in juxtaposition in <i>Otfridi Evang.</i>, lib.
  i. cap. 23. 110. in vol. i. p. 221. of Schilter's <i>Thes. Teut.</i>:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Thoh er nu biliban si,</p>
      <p class="i1">Farames thoh thar er si</p>
      <p>Zi thiu'z nu sar giligge,</p>
      <p class="i1">Thoh er bigraben ligge."</p>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Etsi vero is (Lazarus) jam mortuus est,</p>
      <p class="i1">Eamus tamen ubi is sit,</p>
      <p>Quomodo id jam se habeat (quo in statu sint res ejus),</p>
      <p class="i1">Etiamsi jam sepultus jaceat."</p>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>On which Schilter remarks:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Zi thiu'z nu sar giligge quomodo se res habeat, hodie <i>standi</i>
  verbo utimur,&mdash;wie es stehe, zustehe."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>We thus see that the radical meaning of the word <i>belike</i> is to
  lie or be near, to attend; from which it came to express the <i>simple
  condition</i>, or <i>state of a thing</i>: and it is in this latter sense
  that the word is used as an adverbial or rather an interjectional
  expression, when it may be rendered, <i>it may be so</i>, <i>so it
  is</i>, <i>is it so</i>, &amp;c. Sometimes ironically, sometimes
  expressing chance, &amp;c.; in the course of time it became superseded by
  the more modern term <i>perhaps</i>. Instances of similar elliptical
  expressions are common at the present day, and will readily suggest
  themselves: the modern <i>please</i>, used for entreaty, is
  analogous.</p>

  <p>It is not a little singular that this account of the word
  <i>belike</i> enables us to understand a passage in <i>Macbeth</i>, which
  has been unintelligible to all the commentators and readers of Shakspeare
  down to the present day. I allude to the following, which stands in my
  first folio, Act IV. Sc. 3., thus:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; . &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; . &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; . &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; . &nbsp; &nbsp; What I am truly</p>
      <p>Is thine, and my poor countries, to command:</p>
      <p>Whither indeed before they heere approach,</p>
      <p>Old Seyward, with ten thousand warlike men,</p>
      <p>Already at a point, was setting foorth:</p>
      <p>Now we'll together, and the chance of goodnesse</p>
      <p>Be like our warranted quarrel."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Now it is not easy to see why Malcolm should wish that "chance" should
  "be <i>like</i>," i. e. similar to, their "warranted quarrel;" inasmuch
  as that quarrel was most unfortunate and disastrous. Chance is either
  fortunate or unfortunate. The epithet <i>just</i>, which might apply to
  the quarrel in question, is utterly irreconcilable with <i>chance</i>.
  Still this sense has pleased the editors, and they have made "of
  goodnesse" a precatory and interjectional expression. Surely it is far
  more probable that the poet wrote <i>belike</i> (<i>belicgan</i>,
  <i>geliggen</i>) as one word, and that the meaning of the passage is
  simply "May good fortune attend our enterprise." <span class="sc">Mr.
  Collier's</span> old corrector passes over this difficulty in silence,
  doubtless owing to the circumstance that the word was well understood in
  his time.</p>

  <p>I have alluded to the word <i>like</i> as expressive in the English
  language of three distinct ideas, and in the A.-S. of at least four; is
  it not possible that these meanings, which, as we find the words used,
  are undoubtedly widely distinct, having travelled to us by separate
  channels, may nevertheless have had originally one and the same source? I
  should be glad to elicit the opinion of some one of your more learned
  correspondents as to whether the unused Hebrew <span lang="he"
  class="heb" title="YLN" ><bdo
  dir="rtl">&#x5D9;&#x5DC;&#x5DF;</bdo></span> may not be that source.</p>

<h3>DRUSES.</h3>

  <p>Comparing the initiatory undertaking or covenant of the Druses, as
  represented by Col. Churchill in his very important disclosures
  (<i>Lebanon</i>, ii. 244.), with the original Arabic, and the German
  translation of Eichhorn (<i>Repertorium für Bibl. und Morgenland</i>,
  lib. xii. 222.), I find that the following additions made by Col.
  Churchill (or De Sacy, whom he follows) are not in the Arabic, but appear
  to be glosses or amplifications. For example:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"I put my trust and confidence in our Lord Hakem, the One, the
  Eternal, without attribute and without number."</p>

  <p>"That in serving Him he will serve no other, whether past, present, or
  to come."</p>

  <p>"To the observance of which he sacredly binds himself by the present
  contract and engagement, should he ever reveal the least portion of it to
  others."</p>

  <p>"The most High, King of Kings, [the creator] of the heaven and the
  earth."</p>

  <p>"Mighty and irresistible [force]."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Col. Churchill, although furnishing the amplest account which has yet
  appeared of the Druse religion, secretly held under the colour of
  Mahometanism, has referred very sparingly to the catechisms of this sect,
  which, being for the especial instruction of the two degrees of
  monotheists, constitute the most authentic source of accurate knowledge
  of their faith and practices, and which are to be found in the original
  Arabic, with a German translation in Eichhorn's <i>Repertorium</i> (xii.
  155. 202.). In the same work (xiv. 1., xvii. 27.), Bruns (Kennicott's
  colleague) has furnished from Abulfaragius a biography of <span
  class="correction" title="Original reads `Hamsah, the Hakem', corrected by errata in issue 208."
  >the Hakem</span>; and Adler (xv. 265.) has extracted, from various
  oriental sources, historical notices of the founder of the Druses.</p>

  <p>The subject is peculiarly interesting at the present juncture, as it
  is probable that the Chinese religious movement, partaking of a peculiar
  kind of Christianity, may have originated amongst the Druses, who appear
  from Col. Churchill to have been in expectation of some such movement in
  India or China in connexion with a re-appearance of the Hakem.</p>

<h3>FOLK LORE.</h3>

  <p><i>Legends of the County Clare.</i>&mdash;<i>How Ussheen</i>
  (<i>Ossian</i>) <i>visited the Land of</i> "<i>Thiernah Ogieh</i>"
  (<i>the Country of perpetual Youth</i>).&mdash;Once upon a time, when
  Ussheen was in the full vigour of his youth, it happened that, fatigued
  with the chace, and separated from his companions, he stretched himself
  under a tree to rest, and soon fell asleep. "Awaking with a start," he
  saw a lady, richly clothed and of more than mortal beauty, gazing on him;
  nor was it long until she made him understand that a warmer feeling than
  mere curiosity had attracted her; nor was Ussheen long in responding to
  it. The lady then explained that she was not of mortal birth, and that he
  who wooed an immortal bride must be prepared to encounter dangers such as
  would appal the ordinary race of men. Ussheen, without hesitation,
  declared his readiness to encounter any foe, mortal or immortal, that
  might be opposed to him in her service. The lady then declared herself to
  be the queen of "Thiernah Ogieh," and invited him to accompany her
  thither and share her throne. They then set out on their journey, one in
  all respects similar to that undertaken by Thomas the Rhymer and the
  queen of Faerie, and having overcome all obstacles, arrived at "the land
  of perpetual youth," where all the delights of the terrestrial paradise
  were thrown open to Ussheen, to be enjoyed with only one restriction. A
  broad flat stone was pointed out to him in one part of the palace garden,
  on which he was forbidden to stand, under penalty of the heaviest
  misfortune. One day, however, finding himself near the fatal stone, the
  temptation to stand on it became irresistible, and he yielded to it, and
  immediately found himself in full view of his native land, the existence
  of which he had forgotten from the moment he had entered the kingdom of
  Thiernah Ogieh. But alas! how was it changed from that country he had
  left only a few days since, for "the strong had become weak," and "the
  brave become cowards," while oppression and violence held undisputed sway
  through land. Overcome with grief, he hastened to the the queen to beg
  that he might be restored to his country without delay, that he might
  endeavour to apply some remedy to its misfortunes. The queen's prophetic
  skill made her aware of Ussheen's transgression of her commands before he
  spoke, and she exerted all her persuasive powers to prevail upon him to
  give up his desire to return to Erin, but in vain. She then asked him how
  long he supposed he had been absent from his native land, and on his
  answering "thrice seven days," she amazed him by declaring that three
  times thrice seven years had elapsed since his arrival at the kingdom of
  Thiernah Ogieh; and though Time had no power to enter that land, it would
  immediately assert its dominion over him if he left it. At length she
  persuaded him to promise that he would return to his country for only one
  day, and then come back to dwell with her for ever; and she gave him a
  jet-black horse of surpassing beauty, from whose back she charged him on
  no account to alight, or at all events not to allow the bridle to fall
  from his hand. She farther endued him with wisdom and knowledge far
  surpassing that of men. Having mounted his fairy steed, he soon found
  himself approaching his former home; and as he journeyed he met a man
  <!-- Page 361 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page361"></a>{361}</span>driving before him a horse, across whose
  back was thrown a sack of corn: the sack having fallen a little to one
  side, the man asked Ussheen to assist him in balancing it properly;
  Ussheen instantly stooped from his horse, and catching the sack in his
  right hand, gave it such a heave that it fell over on the other side.
  Annoyed at his mistake, he forgot the injunctions of his bride, and
  sprung from his horse to lift the sack from the ground, letting the
  bridle fall from his hand at the same time: instantly the horse struck
  fire from the ground with his hoofs, and uttering a neigh louder than
  thunder, vanished; at the same instant his curling locks fell from
  Ussheen's head, darkness closed over his beaming eyes, the more than
  mortal strength forsook his limbs, and, a feeble helpless old man, he
  stretched forth his hands seeking some one to lead him: but the mental
  gifts bestowed on him by his immortal bride did not leave him, and,
  though unable to serve his countrymen with his sword, he bestowed upon
  them the advice and instruction which flowed from wisdom greater than
  that of mortals.</p>

<h3>SHAKSPEARE CORRESPONDENCE.</h3>

  <p><i>On "Run-awayes" in Romeo and Juliet.</i>&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Gallop apace, you fiery-footed steedes,</p>

      <p>Leape to these armes, vntalkt of and vnseene."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Your readers will no doubt exclaim, is not this question already
  settled for ever, if not by <span class="sc">Mr. Singer's</span>
  substitution of <i>rumourer's</i>, at least by that of R.&nbsp;H.&nbsp;C., viz.
  <i>rude day's</i>? I must confess that I thought the former so good, when
  it first appeared in these pages, that nothing more was wanted; yet this
  is surpassed by the suggestion of R.&nbsp;H.&nbsp;C. As conjectural emendations,
  they may rank with any that Shakspeare's text has been favoured with; in
  short, the poet might undoubtedly have written either the one or the
  other.</p>

  <p>But this is not the question. The question is, did he write the
  passage as it stands in the first folio, which I have copied above?
  Subsequent consideration has satisfied me that he did. I find the
  following passage in the <i>Merchant of Venice</i>, Act II. Sc. 6.:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="i6hg3">"&mdash;&mdash; but come at once,</p>
      <p>For the close night doth play the run-away,</p>
      <p>And we are staid for at Bassanio's feast."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Is it very difficult to believe that the poet who called the departing
  <i>night</i> a <i>run-away</i> would apply the same term to the
  <i>day</i> under similar circumstances?</p>

  <p>Surely the first folio is a much more correctly printed book than many
  of Shakspeare's editors and critics would have us believe.</p>

  <p class="author">H. C. K.</p>

  <p class="address">&mdash;&mdash; Rectory, Hereford.</p>

  <p>The Word "<i>clamour" in "The Winter's Tale</i>."&mdash;<span
  class="sc">Mr. Keightley</span> complains (Vol viii., p. 241.) that some
  observations of mine (p. 169.) on the word <i>clamour</i>, in <i>The
  Winter's Tale</i>, are precisely similar to his own in Vol. vii., p. 615.
  Had they been so in reality, I presume our Editor would not have inserted
  them; but I think they contain something farther, suggesting, as they do,
  the A.-S. origin of the word, and going far to prove that our modern
  <i>calm</i>, the older <i>clame</i>, the Shakspearian <i>clamour</i>, the
  more frequent <i>clem</i>, Chaucer's <i>clum</i>, &amp;c., all of them
  spring from the same source, viz. the A.-S. <i>clam</i> or <i>clom</i>,
  which means a band, clasp, bandage, chain, prison; from which substantive
  comes the verb <i>clæmian</i>, to clam, to stick or glue together, to
  bind, to imprison.</p>

  <p>If I passed over in silence those points on which <span class="sc">Mr.
  Keightley</span> and myself agreed, I need scarcely assure him that it
  was for the sake of brevity, and not from any want of respect to him.</p>

  <p>I may remark, by the way, on a conjecture of <span class="sc">Mr.
  Keightley's</span> (Vol. vii., p. 615.), that perhaps, in <i>Macbeth</i>,
  Act V. Sc. 5., Shakspeare might have written "till famine <i>clem</i>
  thee," and not, as it stands in the first folio, "till famine
  <i>cling</i> thee," that he is indeed, as he says, "in the region of
  conjecture:" <i>cling</i> is purely A.-S., as he will find in Bosworth,
  "<i>Clingan</i>, to wither, pine, to cling or shrink up; marcescere."</p>

  <p class="author">H. C. K.</p>

  <p class="address">&mdash;&mdash; Rectory, Hereford.</p>

  <p><i>Three Passages in "Measure for Measure.</i>"&mdash;H.&nbsp;C.&nbsp;K. has a
  treacherous memory, or rather, what I believe to be the truth, he, like
  myself, has not a complete Shakspeare apparatus. <span
  class="sc">Collier's</span> first edition surely cannot be in his
  library, or he would have known that Warburton, long ago, read
  <i>seared</i> for <i>feared</i>, and that the same word appears in Lord
  Ellesmere's copy of the first folio, the correction having been made, as
  <span class="sc">Mr. Collier</span> remarks, while the sheet was at
  press. I however assure H.&nbsp;C.&nbsp;K. that I regard his correction as
  perfectly original. Still I have my doubts if <i>seared</i> be the poet's
  word, for I have never met it but in connexion with hot iron; and I
  should be inclined to prefer <i>sear</i> or <i>sere</i>; but this again
  is always physically <i>dry</i>, and not metaphorically so, and I fear
  that the true word is not to be recovered.</p>

  <p>I cannot consent to go back with H.&nbsp;C.&nbsp;K. to the Anglo-Saxon for a
  sense of <i>building</i>, which I do not think it ever bore, at least not
  in our poet's time. His quotation from the "Jewel House," &amp;c. is not
  to the point, for the context shows that "a building word" is a word or
  promise that will <!-- Page 362 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page362"></a>{362}</span>set me a-building, <i>i. e.</i> writing.
  After all I see no difficulty in "the <i>all-building</i> law;" it means
  the law that builds, maintains, and repairs the whole social edifice, and
  is well suited to Angelo, whose object was to enhance the favour he
  proposed to grant.</p>

  <p>Again, if H.&nbsp;C.&nbsp;K. had looked at <span class="sc">Collier's</span>
  edit., he would have seen that in Act I. Sc. 2., <i>princely</i> is the
  reading of the second folio, and not a modern conjecture. If he rejects
  this authority, he must read a little farther on <i>perjury</i> for
  <i>penury</i>. As to the Italian <i>prenze</i>, I cannot receive it. I
  very much doubt Shakspeare's knowledge of Italian, and am sure that he
  would not, if he understood the word, use it as an adjective. <span
  class="sc">Mr. Collier's</span> famed corrector reads with Warburton
  <i>priestly</i>, and substitutes <i>garb</i> for <i>guards</i>, a change
  which convinces me (if proof were wanting) that he was only a guesser
  like ourselves, for it is plain, from the previous use of the word
  <i>living</i>, that <i>guards</i> is the right word.</p>

<h3>DEATH ON THE FINGERS.</h3>

  the <i>old sheep</i>; and the Hebrew saying is, There be as many
  <i>young</i> skulls in Golgotha as <i>old</i>; young men <i>may</i> die
  (for none have or can make any agreement with the grave, or any covenant
  with death, <i>Isa.</i> xxviii. 15. 18.), but old men <i>must</i> die.
  'Tis the grant statute of heaven (<i>Heb.</i> ix. 27.). <i>Senex quasi

  are accounted three parts dead; this lesson we may learn from our

  at the end of the little finger, representing our childhood, rising up to
  a little higher at the end of the ring-finger, which betokens our youth;
  from it to the top of the middle finger, which is the highest point of
  our elevated hand, and so most aptly represents our middle age, when we

  falls fast and far, and breaks (as we say) with a witness. Now, if our

<h2>Queries.</h2>

<h3>LOVETT OF ASTWELL.</h3>

  <p>It is stated in all the pedigrees of this family which I have seen,
  that Thomas Lovett, Esq., of Astwell in Northamptonshire, who died in
  1542, married for his first wife Elizabeth, daughter (Burke calls her
  "heir," <i>Extinct Baronetage</i>, p. 110.) of John Boteler, Esq., of
  Woodhall Watton, in Hertfordshire. The pedigree of the Botelers in
  Clutterbuck's <i>Hertfordshire</i> (vol. ii. p. 476.) does not notice
  this marriage, nor is there any distinct allusion to it in the wills of
  either family. Thomas Lovett's will, dated 20th November, 1542, and
  proved on the following 19th January, does not contain the name of
  Boteler. (<i>Testamenta Vetusta</i>, vol. ii. p. 697.) His father Thomas
  Lovett, indeed, in his will dated 29th October, 7 Henry VII., and proved
  28th January, 1492 (<i>Test. Vetust.</i>, vol. ii. p. 410.), bequeaths to
  Isabel Lovett and Margaret, his daughters, "C<i>l.</i> which John Boteler
  oweth me," but he refers to no relationship between the families. Again,
  "John Butteler, Esquier," by his will, dated 7th September, 1513, and
  proved at Lambeth 11th July, 1515, appoints "his most gracious Maister,
  Maister Thomas Louett," to be supervisor of his will, and bequeaths to
  him "a Sauterbook as a poore remembraunce;" but he alludes to no
  marriage, nor does he mention a daughter Elizabeth. This John Boteler is
  said by Clutterbuck to have married three wives: 1. Katherine, daughter
  of Thomas Acton; 2. Margaret, daughter of Henry Belknap, who died 18th
  August, 1513; 3. Dorothy, daughter of William Tyrrell, Esq., of Gipping
  in Suffolk: the last-mentioned was the mother of his heir, Sir Philip
  Boteler, Kt.; but I can nowhere find who was the mother of the son
  Richard, and the daughters Mary and Joyce mentioned in his will, <!--
  Page 364 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page364"></a>{364}</span>or of
  Thomas Lovett's wife. I cannot help fancying that Elizabeth Lovett was
  his only child by one of his wives, and was perhaps heir to her mother.
  Can one of your contributors bring forward any authority to confirm or
  disprove this conjecture? Whilst I am speaking of the Lovett pedigree, I
  would also advert to two other contradictions in the popular accounts of
  it. That most inaccurate of books, Betham's <i>Baronetage</i>, vol. v. p.
  517., says, Giles Pulton, Esq., of Desborough, married Anne, daughter of
  Thomas Lovett, Esq., of Astwell: the same author, vol. i. p. 299., calls
  her Catherine; which is correct? Neither Anne nor Catherine is mentioned
  in Thomas Lovett the Elder's will (<i>Test. Vetust.</i>, vol. ii. p.
  410). Again, Betham, Burke, and Bridges (<i>History of
  Northamptonshire</i>, "Astwell") have rolled out Thomas Lovett into two
  persons, and in fact have made him appear the son of his second wife Joan
  Billinge, who was not the ancestress of the Lovetts of Astwell at all.
  Nor was it possible she could be; for Thomas Lovett, in his will, dated
  1492, speaks of her as "Joan, my wife, late the wife of John Hawys, one
  of the Justices of the Common Pleas." Now this John Hawys was living in
  1487, and Lovett's son and heir, Thomas, was seventeen years old in 1492.
  The abstract of Lovett's will in the <i>Test. Vetust.</i>, calling Thomas
  Lovett the Younger "my son and heir by the said Joan my wife," must
  therefore be manifestly incorrect. I will not apologise for the
  minuteness of this account, as I believe the correction of detail in
  published pedigrees to be one of the most valuable features of "N. &amp;
  Q.;" but I am almost ashamed of the length of my communication, which I
  hope some of your readers may throw light upon.</p>

<h3>OATHS.</h3>

  <p>The very remarkable distinction between the manner in which English
  and Welsh witnesses take the book at the time when they are sworn, has
  often struck me. An English witness always takes the book with his
  fingers under, and his thumb at the top of the book. A Welsh witness, on
  the contrary, takes it with his fingers at the top, and his thumb under
  the book. How has this singular difference arisen? I am inclined to
  suggest that originally the oath was taken by merely laying the hand on
  the top of the book, without kissing it. Lord Coke (3 <i>Inst.</i> 165.)
  says, "It is called a corporal oath, because he toucheth with his hand
  some part of the Holy Scripture." And Jacob (<i>L.&nbsp;D.</i>, "Oath"), says
  it is so called "because the witness, when he swears, <i>lays his right
  hand upon</i>, and toucheth the Holy Evangelists." And Lord Hale (2
  <i>H.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;C.</i> 279.) says, "The regular oath, as is allowed by the laws
  of England, is 'Tactis sacrosanctis Dei Evangeliis'," and in case of a
  Jew, "Tacto libro legis Mosaicæ:" and, if I rightly remember, the oath as
  administered in the Latin form at Oxford concludes: "Ita te Deus adjuvet,
  tactis sacrosanctis Christi Evangeliis." In none of these instances does
  kissing the book appear to be essential. Whereas the present form used in
  the Courts is, "So help you God, kiss the book;" but still the witness is
  always required to touch the book with his hand, and he is never
  permitted to hold the book with his hand in a glove. When then did the
  practice of kissing the book originate? And how happens it that the Welsh
  and English take the book in the hand in the different manners I have
  described?</p>

<h3>THE ELECTRIC TELEGRAPH.</h3>

  <p>Powerful as this extraordinary agent has become, and incalculably
  useful as its operation is now found to be, it would appear that the
  principle of the electric telegraph and its <i>modus operandi</i>, almost
  identically as at present, were known and described upwards of a century
  ago. On the occasion of a late visit to Robert Baird, Esq., of
  Auchmeddan, at his residence, Cadder House, near Glasgow, my attention
  was called by that gentleman to a letter initialed C.&nbsp;M., dated Renfrew,
  Feb. 15, <span class="correction" title="Original reads `1653', corrected by errata in issue 208."
  >1753</span>, and published that year in the <i>Scots Magazine</i>, vol.
  xv. p. 73., where the writer not only suggests electricity as a medium
  for conveying messages and signals, but details with singular minuteness
  the method of opening and maintaining lingual communication between
  remote points, a method which, with only few improvements, has now been
  so eminently successful. It is usual to attribute this wonderful
  discovery to the united labours of Mr. W.&nbsp;F. Cooke and Professor
  Wheatstone, but has any one acknowledged the contribution of C.&nbsp;M., and
  can any of the learned correspondents of "N. &amp; Q." inform me who he
  was?</p>

  tree, cut down some years since on the estate of J.&nbsp;W. Martin, Esq., at
  Showborough, in the parish of Twyning, Gloucestershire. There was never
  till quite lately any house of importance on the spot, nor is there any
  trace of intrenchments to be discovered. The tree stood at some distance
  from the banks of the Avon, and on the other side of that river runs the
  road from Tewkesbury through Bredon to Pershore. The ball in question is
  marked with the broad arrow. From whence and at what period was the shot
  fired?</p>

  Ireland Paddy will say, "God bless your honour," or "Long life to your

  "salam" on these occasions.</p>

  <p>There is also, I believe, a popular idea among some of sneezing having
  some connexion with Satanic agency; and I lately met with a case where a
  peculiar odour was invariably distinguishable by two sisters, on a
  certain individual violently sneezing.</p>

  <p>It is currently reported, and nine men in ten will tell you, if you
  ask them the reason why goose is always eaten on the 29th Sept.,
  Michaelmas Day, that Queen Elizabeth was eating goose when the news of
  the destruction of the Invincible Armada was brought, and she immediately
  put down her knife and fork, and said, "From this day forth let all
  British-born subjects eat goose on this day."</p>

  <p>Now in Creasy's <i>Battles</i> it is stated that the Spanish fleet was
  destroyed in the month of July. How could it then be the 29th of Sept.
  when the news of its defeat reached her majesty? If any of your readers

  eating goose has in this country been transferred to Michaelmas Day,
  while on the Continent it is observed at Martinmas, from which practice
  the goose is often called <i>St. Martin's bird</i>, it is very easy to
  prove that there is no foundation for the tradition referred to by our
  correspondent. For the following extract from Stow's <i>Annales</i> (ed.
  Howes), p. 749., will show that, so far from the news of the defeat of
  the Armada not reaching Elizabeth until the 29th of September, public

<h3>PORTRAITS OF HOBBES AND LETTERS OF HOLLAR.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">(Vol. viii., p. 221.)</p>

  <p>Although I cannot answer the question of <span class="sc">Sir Walter
  Trevelyan</span>, the following notices respecting the portraits of the
  Philosopher of Malmesbury may not be unacceptable to him and to those who
  hold this distinguished man's memory in high respect.</p>

  <p>That admirable gossip, John Aubrey, who lived in habits of intimacy
  with Hobbes, has left us such a lively picture of the man, his person,
  and his manners, as to leave nothing to desire. In reading it we cannot
  but regret that Aubrey had not been a cotemporary of our great poet,
  about whom he has been only able to furnish us with some hearsay
  anecdotes.</p>

  <p>Aubrey tells us that&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Sir Charles Scarborough, M.D., Physician to his Royal Highness the
  Duke of York, much loved the conversation of Hobbes, and hath a picture
  of him (drawne about 1655), under which is this distich:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg1">'Si quæris de me, mores inquire, sed ille</p>
      <p class="i1">Qui quærit de me, forsitan alter erit.'"</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>"In their meeting (<i>i. e.</i> the Royal Society) at Gresham College
  is his picture drawne by the life, 1663, by a good hand, which they much
  esteeme, and several copies have been taken of it."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>In a note Aubrey says:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"He did me the honour to sit for his picture to Jo. Baptist Caspars,
  an excellent painter, and 'tis a good piece. I presented it to the
  Society twelve years since."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>In other places he tells us:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Amongst other of his acquaintance I must not forget Mr. Samuel Cowper
  (Cooper), the prince of limners of this last age, who drew his picture as
  like as art could afford, and one of the best pieces that ever he did
  which his Majesty, at his returne, bought of him, and conserves as one of
  his greatest rarities in his closet at Whitehall."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>In a note he adds:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"This picture I intend to be borrowed of his Majesty for Mr. Loggan to
  engrave an accurate piece by, which will sell well both at home and
  abroad."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Again he says:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Mr. S. Cowper (at whose house Hobbes and Sir William Petty often met)
  drew his picture twice: the first the King has; the other is yet in the
  custody of his (Cooper's) widowe; but he (Cowper) gave it indeed to me
  (and I promised I would give it to the archives at Oxon), but I, like a
  fool, did not take possession of it, for something of the garment was not
  quite finished, and he died, I being then in the country."</p>

</blockquote>

<p><!-- Page 369 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page369"></a>{369}</span></p>

  <p>This picture is, I believe, now in my possession. It is a small
  half-length oil painting, measuring about twelve inches by nine. Hobbes
  is represented at an open arch or window, with his book, the Leviathan,
  open before him; the dress is, as Aubrey states, unfinished, and beneath
  is the remarkable inscription,&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"AUT EGO INSANIO SOLUS: AUT EGO SOLUS NON INSANIO."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>It represents the philosopher at an advanced age, and is conformable
  in every respect to the following description of his person:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"In his old age he was very bald, yet within dore he used to study and
  sit bareheaded, and said he never tooke cold in his head, but that the
  greatest trouble was to keepe off the flies from pitching on the
  baldness. His head was of a mallet forme, approved by the physiologers.
  His face not very great, ample forehead, yellowish-red whiskers, which
  naturally turned up; belowe he was shaved close, except a little tip
  under his lip; not but that nature would have afforded him a venerable
  beard, but being mostly of a cheerful and pleasant humour, he affected
  not at all austerity and gravity, and to look severe. He considered
  gravity and heavinesse of countenance not so good marks of assurance of
  God's favour, as a cheerful charitable, and upright behaviour, which are
  better signes of religions than the zealous maintaining of controverted
  doctrines. He had a good eie, and that of a hazel colour, which was full
  of life and spirit, even to his last; when he was in discourse, there
  shone (as it were) a bright live coale within it. He had two kinds of
  looks; when he laught, was witty, and in a merry humour, one could scarce
  see his eies; by and by, when he was serious and earnest, he opened his
  eies round his eie-lids: he had middling eies, not very big nor very
  little. He was six foote high and something better, and went
  indifferently erect, or rather, considering his great age, very
  erect."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Aubrey was one of the patrons of Hollar, of whom he has also given us
  some brief but interesting particulars. The two following letters, which
  were transcribed by Malone when he contemplated a publication of the
  Aubrey papers, deserve preservation; indeed, one of them relates
  immediately to the subject of this notice:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Sir,</p>

  <p>"I have now done the picture of Mr. Hobbes, and have showed it to some
  of his acquaintance, who say it to be very like; but Stent has deceived
  me, and maketh demurr to have it of me; as that at this present my labour
  seemeth to be lost, for it lyeth dead by me. However, I returne you many
  thankes for lending mee the Principall, and I have halve a dozen copies
  for you, and the painting I have delivered to your Messenger who brought
  it to mee before.</p>

<p class="cenhead">"[For Mr. Aubrey.]</p>

  <p>"Sir,</p>

  <p>"I have beene told this morning that you are in Town, and that you

</blockquote>

  <p>This minute localising of one of the humble workshops of this
  admirable artist may not be unacceptable to <span class="sc">Mr. Peter
  Cunningham</span> for some future edition of his very interesting
  <i>Handbook of London</i>. It may not be amiss to add that Hollar died on
  the 25th of March 1677, in the seventieth year of his age and that he was
  buried in St. Margaret's churchyard, Westminster, near the north-west
  corner of the tower, but without stone to mark the spot.</p>

<h3>PAROCHIAL LIBRARIES.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">(Vol. viii., p. 62.)</p>

  <p>In the vestry of the fine old priory church at Cartmel, in Lancashire,
  there is a good library, chiefly of divinity, consisting of about three
  hundred volumes, placed in a commodious room, and kept in nice order.
  This small but valuable collection was left to the parish by Thomas
  Preston, of Holker, Esq.</p>

  <p>There is another in the vestry of the church at Castleton, in
  Derbyshire; or rather in a room built expressly to contain then,
  adjoining the vestry. They were left to the parish by the Rev. James
  Farrer, M.A., who had been vicar of Castleton for about forty-five years,
  and consist of about two thousand volumes in good condition, partly
  theological and partly miscellaneous, about equally divided, which are
  lent to the parishioners at the discretion of the vicar. Mr. Farrer left
  behind him a maiden sister, and a brother-in-law Mr. Hamilton, who
  resided in Bath; the former of whom erected the room containing the
  books, and a vestry at the same time and both considerably augmented the
  number of volumes, and made the library what it now is.</p>

  <p>Under the chancel of the spacious and venerable parish church of
  Halifax, in Yorkshire, are some large rooms upon a level with the lower
  part of the churchyard, in one of which is contained a good library of
  books. Robert Clay, D.D., vicar of Halifax, who died April 9, 1628, was
  buried in this library, which he is said to have built. <!-- Page 370
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page370"></a>{370}</span></p>

  <p>In the Rectory House at Whitchurch, in Shropshire, built by Richard
  Newcome, D.D., rector of that place, and afterwards Bishop of St. Asaph,
  there is a valuable library left as an heirloom by the bequest of Jane,
  Countess Dowager of Bridgewater; who, in the year 1707, having purchased
  from his executors the library of the Reverend Clement Sankey, D.D.,
  rector of Whitchurch, for 305<i>l.</i>, left it for ever for the use of
  the rectors for the time being. The number of the volumes was 2250:
  amongst which are a fine copy of Walton's <i>Polyglott Bible</i>, some of
  the ancient Fathers, and other valuable theological works. This
  collection has been subsequently increased by a bequest from the late
  Rev. Francis Henry, Earl of Bridgewater (of eccentric memory), rector of
  Whitchurch, who by his will, dated in 1825, gave the whole of his own
  books in the Rectory House at Whitchurch, to be added to the others, and
  left also the sum of 150<i>l.</i> to the rector to be invested in his
  name, and the dividends thereof expended by him, together with the money
  arising from the sale of his lordship's wines and liquors in his cellars
  at Whitchurch, in the purchase of printed books for the use of the
  rectors of that parish for the time being.</p>

  <p>The same noble earl presented to the rector of Middle, in the county
  of Salop, a small collection of books towards founding a library there:
  and bequeathed by his will the sum of 800<i>l.</i>, to be applied, under
  the direction of the rector of Middle for the time being, for augmenting
  this library. He also left a farther sum of 150<i>l.</i> to be invested
  in the name of the rector; and the dividends thereof expended by him in
  the purchase of books for the continual augmentation of the library, in
  the same manner as he had done at Whitchurch.</p>

  <p>It is to this Earl of Bridgewater that we are indebted not only for
  those valuable works the <i>Bridgewater Treatises</i>, but also for large
  bequests of money and landed property to the trustees of the British
  Museum, for the purchase of manuscripts, in addition to those from his
  own collection, which he had already bequeathed to the same
  institution.</p>

<h3>BATTLE OF VILLERS EN COUCHÉ.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">(Vol. viii., pp. 8. 127.)</p>

  <p>I am in a position to furnish a more complete account of this
  skirmish, and of the action of April 26, in which my grandfather, General
  Mansel, fell, from a copy of the <i>Evening Mail</i> of May 14, 1794, now
  in the possession of J.&nbsp;C. Mansel, Esq., of Cosgrove Hall,
  Northamptonshire. Your correspondent <span class="sc">Mr. T.&nbsp;C.
  Smith</span> appears to have been misinformed as to the immediate

  <p>"<i>Particulars of the Glorious Victory obtained by the English
  Cavalry over the French under the Command of General Chapuis, at
  Troisoille, on the 26th of April, 1794.</i></p>

  <p>"On the 25th, according to orders received from the Committee of
  Public Safety, and subsequently from General Pichegru, General Chapuis,
  who commanded the Camp of Cæsar, marched from thence with his whole
  force, consisting of 25,000 infantry, 3000 cavalry, and seventy-five
  pieces of cannon. At Cambray he divided them into three columns; the one
  marched by Ligny, and attacked the redoubt at Troisoille, which was most
  gallantly defended by Col. Congreve against this column of 10,000 men.
  The second column was then united, consisting of 12,000 men, which
  marched on the high road as far as Beausois, and from that village turned
  off to join the first column; and the attack recommenced against Col.
  Congreve's redoubt, who kept the whole at bay. The enemy's flank was
  supported by the village of Caudry, to defend which they had six pieces
  of cannon, 2000 infantry, and 500 cavalry. During this period Gen. Otto
  conceived it practicable to fall on their flank with the cavalry; in
  consequence of which, Gen. Mansel, with about 1450 men&mdash;consisting
  of the Blues, 1st and 3rd Dragoon Guards, 5th Dragoon Guards, and 1st
  Dragoons, 15th and 16th Dragoons, with Gen. Dundas, and a division of
  Austrian cuirassiers, and another of Archduke Ferdinand's hussars under
  Prince Swartzenburg&mdash;after several man&oelig;uvres, came up with the
  enemy in the village of Caudry, through which they charged, putting the
  cavalry to flight, and putting a number of infantry to the sword, and
  taking the cannon. Gen. Chapuis, perceiving the attack on the village of
  Caudry, sent down the regiment of carabineers to support those troops;
  but the succour came too late, and this regiment was charged by the
  English light dragoons and the hussars, and immediately gave way with
  some little loss. The charge was then continued against a battery of
  eight pieces of cannon behind a small ravine, which was soon carried;
  and, with equal rapidity, the heavy cavalry rushed on to attack a battery
  of fourteen pieces of cannon, placed on an eminence behind a very steep
  ravine, into which many of the front ranks fell; and the cannon, being
  loaded with grape, did some execution: however, a considerable body, with
  Gen. Mansel at their head, passed the ravine, and charged the cannon with
  inconceivable intrepidity, and their efforts were crowned with the utmost
  success. This event decided the day, and the remaining time was passed in
  cutting down battalions, till every man and horse was obliged to give up
  the pursuit from fatigue. It was at the mouth of this battery that the
  brave and worthy Gen. Mansel was shot: one grape-shot entering his chin,
  fracturing the spine, and coming out between the shoulders; and the other
  breaking his arm to splinters; his horse was also killed under him, his
  Brigade-Major Payne's horse shot, and his son and aide-de-camp, Capt.
  Mansel, wounded and taken prisoner; and it is since known that he was

  name="page371"></a>{371}</span>Arras. The French lost between 14,000 and
  15,000 men killed; we took 580 prisoners. The loss in tumbrils and
  ammunition was immense, and in all fifty pieces of cannon, of which
  thirty-five fell to the English; twenty-seven to the heavy, and eight to
  the light cavalry. Thus ended a day which will redound with immortal
  honour to the bravery of the British cavalry, who, assisted by a small
  body of Austrians, the whole not amounting to 1500, gained so complete a
  victory over 22,000 men in sight of their <i>corps de reserve</i>,
  consisting of 6000 men and twenty pieces of cannon. Had the cavalry been
  more numerous, or the infantry able to come up, it is probable few of the
  French would have escaped. History does not furnish such an example of
  courage.</p>

  <p>"The whole army lamented the loss of the brave General, who thus
  gloriously terminated a long military career, during which he had been
  ever honoured, esteemed, and respected by all who knew him. It should be
  some consolation to those he has left behind him, that his reputation was
  as unsullied as his soul was honest; and that he died as he lived, an
  example of true courage, honour, and humility. On the 24th General Mansel
  narrowly escaped being surrounded at Villers de Couché by the enemy,
  owing to a mistake of General Otto's aide-de-camp, who was sent to bring
  up the heavy cavalry: in doing which he mistook the way, and led them to
  the front of the enemy's cannon, by which the 3rd Dragoon Guards suffered
  considerably."&mdash;Extract from the <i>Evening Mail</i>, May 14,
  1794.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>From the above extract, compared with the communication of <span
  class="sc">Mr. Smith</span> (Vol. viii., p. 127.), it appears that the
  15th Light Dragoons were engaged in both actions, that of Villers en
  Couché on April 24, and that of Troisoille (or Cateau) on the 26th. In
  the statement communicated by <span class="sc">Mr. Simpson</span>
  (<i>Ibid.</i> p. 8.), there appears to be some confusion between the
  particulars of the two engagements.</p>

  <p class="author"><span class="sc">H. L. Mansel, B.D.</span></p>

  <p class="address">St. John's College, Oxford</p>

  <p>As the action at Villers en Couché has lately been brought before your
  readers, allow me to direct your correspondent to the <i>Journals and
  Correspondence of Sir Harry Calvert</i>, edited by Sir Harry Verney, and
  just published by Messrs. Hurst and Co.,&mdash;a book which contains a
  good deal of valuable information respecting a memorable campaign. Sir
  Harry Calvert, under the date of the 25th of April, 1794, thus describes
  the action at Villers en Couché:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Since Tuesday, as I foresaw was likely, we have been a good deal on
  the <i>qui vive</i>. On Wednesday morning we had information that the
  enemy had moved in considerable force from the Camp de César, and early
  in the afternoon we learned that they had crossed the Selle at Saultzoir,
  and pushed patrols towards Quesnoy and Valenciennes. The Duke [of York]
  sent orders to General Otto, who had gone out to Cambray on a
  reconnoitring party with light dragoons and hussars, to get into the rear
  of the enemy, find out their strength, and endeavour to cut them off. The
  enemy retired to Villers en Couché that night, but occupied Saultzoir and
  Haussy. Otto, fielding their strength greater than he expected, about
  14,000, early in the evening sent in for a brigade of heavy cavalry for
  his support, which marched first to Fontaine Antarque, and afterwards to
  St. Hilaire; and in the night he sent for a farther support of four
  battalions and some artillery. Unfortunately he confided this important
  mission to a hussar, who never delivered it, probably having lost his
  way, so that, in the morning, the general found himself under the
  necessity of attacking with very inferior numbers. However, by repeated
  charges of his light cavalry, he drove the enemy back into their camp,
  and took three pieces of cannon. He had, at one time, taken eight; but
  the enemy, bringing up repeated reinforcements of fresh troops, retook
  five.</p>

  <p>"Our loss I cannot yet ascertain, but I fear the 15th Light Dragoons
  have suffered considerably. Two battalions of the enemy are entirely
  destroyed."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>The especial bravery of the troops engaged on the 26th, which is
  another subject noticed by your correspondent <span
  class="sc">Bibliothecar. Chetham</span>. prompted the following entry on
  his journal by Sir Harry Calvert:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"April 26.&mdash;The enemy made a general attack on the camp of the
  allies. On their approaching the right of the camp, the Duke of York
  directed a column of heavy cavalry, consisting of the regiment of
  Zedwitsch Cuirassiers, the Blues, Royals, 1st, 3rd, and 5th Dragoon
  Guards, to turn the enemy, or endeavour to take them in flank, which
  service they performed in a style beyond all praise, charging repeatedly
  through the enemy's column, and taking twenty-six pieces of cannon. The
  light dragoons and hussars took nine pieces on the left of the Duke's
  camp."</p>

<h3>ATTAINMENT OF MAJORITY.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">(Vol. viii., pp. 198. 250. 296.)</p>

  <p>The misunderstanding which has arisen between <span
  class="sc">Professor De Morgan</span> and A.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;B. has proceeded, it
  appears, from the misapplication of the statement of the latter's
  authority (Arthur Hopton) to the question at issue. Where Hopton says
  that our lawyers count their day from sunrise to sunset, he, I am of
  opinion, merely refers to certain instances, such as distress for
  rent:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"A man cannot distrain for rent or rent-charge in the night (which,
  according to the author of <i>The Mirror</i>, is after sunset and before
  sunrising)."&mdash;<i>Impey on Distress and Replevin</i>, p. 49.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>In common law, the day is now supposed among lawyers to be from six in
  the morning to seven at night for service of notices; in Chancery till
  eight at night. And a service after such times at night <!-- Page 372
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page372"></a>{372}</span>would be
  counted as good only for the next day. In the case of Liffin <i>v.</i>
  Pitcher, 1 <i>Dowl. N.&nbsp;S.</i> 767., Justice Coleridge said, "I am in the
  habit of giving twenty-four hours to plead when I give one day." Thus it
  will be perceived that a lawyer's day is of different lengths.</p>

  <p>With regard to the time at which a person arrives at majority, we have
  good authority in support of <span class="sc">Professor De
  Morgan's</span> statement:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"So that full age in male or female is twenty-one years, which age is
  completed on the day preceding the anniversary of a person's birth, who
  till that time is an infant, and so styled in law."&mdash;Blackstone's
  <i>Commentaries</i>, vol. i. p. 463.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>There is no doubt also that the law rejects fractions of a day where
  it is possible:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"It is clear that the law rejecteth all fractions of days for the
  uncertainty, and commonly allows him that hath part of the day in law to
  have the whole day, unless where it, by fraction or relation, may be a
  prejudice to a third person."&mdash;Sir O. Bridgm. l.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>And in respect to the present case it is quite clear. In the case of
  Reg. <i>v.</i> The Parish of St. Mary, Warwick, reported in the
  <i>Jurist</i> (vol. xvii. p. 551.), Lord Campbell said:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"In some cases the Court does not regard the fraction of a day. Where
  the question is on what day a person came of age, the fraction of the day
  on which he was born and on which he came of age is not considered."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>And farther on he says:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"It is a general maxim that the law does not regard the fraction of a
  day."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p class="author"><span class="sc">Russell Gole.</span></p>

  <p>I only treat misquotation as an <i>offence</i> in the old sense of the
  word; and courteously, but most positively, I deny the right of any one
  who quotes to omit, or to alter emphasis, without stating what he has
  done. That A.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;B. did misunderstand me, I was justified in inferring
  from his implication (p. 198. col. 2) that I made the day begin "a minute
  after midnight."</p>

  <p>Arthur Hopton, whom A. E. B. quotes against me (but the quotation is
  from chapter xiv., not xiii.), is wrong in his law. The lawyers, from
  Coke down to our own time, give both days, the natural and artificial, as
  legal days. See Coke Littleton (Index, <i>Day</i>), the current
  commentators on Blackstone, and the usual law dictionaries.</p>

  <p>Nevertheless, this discussion will serve the purpose. No one denies
  that the day of majority now begins at midnight: no one pretends to
  prove, by evidence of decisions, or opinion of writers on law, that it
  began otherwise in 1600. How then did Ben Jonson make it begin, as
  clearly A.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;B. shows he does, at six o'clock (meaning probably a
  certain sunrise)? Hopton throws out the natural day altogether in a work
  on chronology, and lays down the artificial day as the only one known to
  lawyers: it is not wonderful that Jonson should have fallen into the same
  mistake.</p>

<h3>SIMILARITY OF IDEA IN ST. LUKE AND JUVENAL.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">(Vol. viii., p. 195.)</p>

  <p>I send, as a pendant to <span class="sc">Mr. Weir's</span> lines from
  Juvenal, the following extract from Cicero:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Sed in eâ es urbe, in quâ hæc, vel plura, et ornatiora, <i>parietes
  ipsi loqui</i> posse videantur."&mdash;Cic. <i>Epist.</i>, 1. vi. 3.:
  Torquato, Pearce's 12mo. edition.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Most, if not all, of the readers of "N. &amp; Q." are I believe,
  pleased by having their attention drawn to parallel passages in which a
  similarity of idea or thought is found. Let us adopt for conciseness the
  term "parallel passages" (frequently used in "N. &amp; Q."), as embracing
  every kind of similarity. Contributions of such passages to "N. &amp; Q."
  would form a very interesting collection. I should be particularly
  pleased by a full collection of parallel passages from the Scriptures and
  ancient and modern literature, and especially Shakspeare. (See <span
  class="sc">Mr. Buckton's</span> "Shakspearian Parallels," <i>antè</i>, p.
  240.)</p>

  <p>To prevent sending passages that have been inserted in "N. &amp; Q.,"
  every note should refer to the note immediately preceding. I send the
  following parallel passages with some hesitation, because I have not my
  volumes of "N. &amp; Q." at hand, to ascertain whether they have already
  appeared, and because they are probably familiar to your readers. I do
  not, however, send them as novelties, but as a contribution to the
  collection which I wish to see made:</p>

<h3>PHOTOGRAPHIC CORRESPONDENCE.</h3>

  <p><i>Mr. Sisson's developing Fluid.</i>&mdash;Since I sent you the new
  formula for <span class="sc">Mr. Sisson's</span> positive developer,
  which you published in Vol. viii., p. 301., <span class="sc">Mr.
  Sisson</span> has written to me to say that if, instead of the acetic
  acid, you add two drachms of formic acid, the new agent proposed by <span
  class="sc">Mr. Lyte</span>, you certainly obtain the sweetest-toned
  positives he has ever seen. The pictures, he says, come out very quickly
  with it indeed; and with a small lens in a sitting-room he can in about
  ten seconds obtain the most wonderful detail. Every wrinkle in the face,
  and ladies' lace ribbons or cap-strings, he says, come out
  beautifully.</p>

  <p>The formula then, as improved by <span class="sc">Mr. Sisson</span>,
  is&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>Water                       5 oz.</p>

  <p><i>Dr. Diamond's Process for Albumenized
  Paper.</i>&mdash;Photographers are under many obligations to <span
  class="sc">Dr. Diamond</span>, particularly for the valuable information
  communicated through "N. &amp; Q.," and his obligingness in answering
  inquiries. I make no doubt he will readily reply to the following
  questions, suggested by his late letter on the process for printing on
  albumenized paper.</p>

  <p>Will the solution of forty grains of common salt and forty grains of
  mur. amm., <i>without the albumen</i>, be found to answer for ordinary
  positive paper (say Canson's, Turner's, or Whatman's)? and, in that case,
  may it be applied with a brush?</p>

  <p>Will the forty-grain solution of nit. sil. (without amm.) answer for
  paper so prepared? and may this also be applied with a brush?</p>

  <p>Should the positives be printed out very strongly? and how long should
  they remain in the <i>saturated</i> bath of hypo.?</p>

  <p>Is not the use of sel d'or subject to the objection that the pictures
  with which it is used are liable to fade in time?</p>

  <p><span class="sc">Dr. Diamond</span> says that pictures produced by the
  use of amm. nit. of silver are not to be depended on for permanency. If
  this be so, it is very important it should be known, as the use of amm.
  nit. is at present generally recommended and adopted.</p>

  <p class="author">C. E. F.</p>

  <p><i>Mr. Lyte's New Process.</i>&mdash;Although I presume it is none of
  your affair what is said or done in "another place," will you kindly ask
  <span class="sc">Mr. Lyte</span> for me, if he will be so good as to
  explain the discrepancy which appears between his "new processes," as
  given in the Journal of the Photographic Society of Sept. 21, and "N.
  &amp; Q." of Sept. 10? In the former he says, for sensitizing, take
  (amongst other things) iodide of ammonia 60 grains: in "N. &amp; Q.," on
  the contrary, what would seem to be the same receipt, or intended as the
  same, gives the quantity of this salt one fourth less, 45 grains&mdash;a
  vast difference. Again, in the developing solution the quantity of formic
  acid is <i>double</i> in your paper what it is in the journal.</p>

  <p>I should not have trespassed on your space, but would have written to
  <span class="sc">Mr. Lyte</span> directly, except from the fear that some
  other unfortunate practitioner may have stumbled over the same impediment
  as I have done, and may not have had courage to make the inquiry.</p>

  <p class="author">S. B.</p>

<div class="note">
  <p>[Having forwarded this communication to <span class="sc">Mr.
  Lyte</span>, we have received from that gentleman the following
  explanations of his process, &amp;c.]</p>

</div>

  <p>The process which was published in the <i>Photographic Journal</i>
  was, I am sorry to say, not quite correct in its proportions, on account
  of a mistake in inclosing the wrong letter to the Editor; but the mistake
  will, I trust, be rectified by another communication which I have now
  sent.</p>

  <p>The whole of the formulæ, however, as given in "N. &amp; Q.," are
  quite correct.</p>

  <p>Let me now, however, trespass on your pages by a few more answers to
  several other Querists, and which at the same time may be acceptable to
  some of your readers.</p>

  <p>1. The developing agents which are made with iron are very applicable
  as baths to immerse the plate in; and the formic acid, from its powerful
  deoxidizing property, renders the iron salt more stable during long use
  and exposure to the air.</p>

  <p>2. In coating paper with albumen, if the upper edge of the paper be
  sufficiently turned back, and the paper be forced down sufficiently on to
  the surface of the albumen, no bubbles will form; and <!-- Page 374
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page374"></a>{374}</span>the operator
  will not be troubled with the streaks so often complained of.</p>

  <p>3. No time can possibly be fixed for the exposure of the positive to
  the action of the hypo.; and to produce the best effects, the positive
  must be continually watched, both while printing and while in the
  hypo.</p>

  <p>4. No hot iron should be applied to the positive after being printed,
  but the picture should be allowed to dry spontaneously.</p>

  <p>5. The developing agent with the pyrogallic and formic acids will keep
  good a very long time, longer, I think, than that in which acetic acid is
  used, but cannot be used as a dipping bath.</p>

  <p>6. I find the formic acid which I obtain from different chemists
  rather variable in its strength. What I use is rather below the average
  strength, so that in general about six drachms of the commercial acid
  will suffice where I use one ounce; but the excess seems to produce no
  bad result.</p>

  <p>7. A great advantage of the pyrogallic developer which I recommend, is
  that of its being able to be diluted to almost any extent, with no other
  result than simply making the development slower. Another point is also
  worthy of notice, viz. a method by which even a very weak positive on
  glass may be converted into a very strong negative.</p>

  <p>I take a saturated solution of bichloride of mercury in hydrochloric
  acid, and add of this one to six parts of water. This I pour over the
  collodion plate, and watch it till the whitening process is quite
  complete. Having well washed the surface with water, I pour over it a
  solution of iodide of potassium, very weak, not more than two or three
  grains to the ounce of water. The effect of this is to turn the white
  parts to a brilliant yellow, quite impervious to actinic rays. This
  process is only applicable to weak negative or instantaneous pictures,
  as, if used on a picture of much intensity, the opacity produced is too
  great. By using, however, instead of the iodide of potassium, a weak
  solution of ammonia, as recommended by Mr. Hunt, a less degree of
  intensity may be produced again a less intensity by hyposulphate of soda
  and a less degree again, but still a slight darkening, by pouring on the
  bichloride and pouring it off at once before the whitening commences. I
  thus can tell the exact degree of negative effect in any picture of
  whatever intensity. The terchloride of gold is most uncertain in its
  results, at any rate I find it so.</p>

  <p>I must again beg you to excuse the great length of my communication,
  and hope it will be of service to my fellow photographers.</p>

<h2>Replies to Minor Queries.</h2>

  <p><i>Derivation of the Word "Island</i>" (Vol. viii., p. 49.).&mdash;I
  have received through the kindness of Hensleigh Wedgwood, Esq., a copy of
  the <i>Philological Journal</i> for Feb. 21, 1851, in which my late
  observations on the etymology of the word <i>island</i> are shown to be
  almost identical with his own, published more than two years ago, even
  the minutest particulars. His own surprise on seeing my remarks must have
  been at least as great as my own, on learning how singularly I had been
  anticipated; and those of your readers who will refer to the number of
  the journal in question, will be doubtless as much surprised as either of
  us.</p>

  <p>This coincidence suggests two things: first, the truth of the
  etymology in question, secondly, the excellency of that spirit which (as
  in this instance) "thinketh no evil;" and, in so close a resemblance of
  ideas as that before us, rather than at once start a charge of
  plagiarism, will believe that it is possible for two persons, with
  similar habits of thought, to arrive at the same end, and that, too, by
  singularly identical means, when engaged on one and the same subject.</p>

  <p>"<i>Pætus and Arria</i>" (Vol. viii., p. 219.).&mdash;As I have not
  observed a reply to the Query respecting the author of <i>Pætus and
  Arria</i>, a tragedy, I beg to state that the work was not written by a
  gentleman of the University of Cambridge, but by Mr. Nicholson, son of
  Mr. Nicholson, a well-known and highly respectable bookseller in
  Cambridge, in the early part of the present century. The young man, who,
  besides being unfailing in his attention to business, had a literary
  turn, and was attached to the fine arts, died in the prime of life. After
  his death, the poor father, with tears in his eyes, presented me with a
  copy of the tragedy. I am glad to record this testimony to the character
  of persons well known to me during several years.</p>

  <p>"<i>That Swinney</i>" (Vol. viii, p. 213.).&mdash;I am well pleased
  with the manner in which T.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;J. has unearthed "that Swinney," if
  indeed, as is very probable, Sidney Swinney really was the man who
  interfered with <i>the great unknown</i>. It may not be impertinent to
  state that Sidney Swinney, who was of Clare Hall, Cambridge, became B.A.
  in 1744, M.A. in 1749, and D.D. (<i>per saltum</i>) in 1763. It may also
  be worth noting that a George Swinney, of the same college, became B.A.
  in 1767, and M.A. in 1770. This <i>George</i> Swinney <i>may</i> have
  been <i>Sidney</i> Swinney's son, or his near relation; and <i>may</i>
  have been the man who went to Lord G. Sackville in July, 1769; but I
  think this not likely. I will only observe farther that, in the "Graduati
  Cantabrigienses," <!-- Page 375 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page375"></a>{375}</span>the names are spelled <i>Swiney</i>; but
  changes of this kind, by the parties themselves, are by no means
  uncommon.</p>

  <p>The question, whether Swinney had ever <i>before</i> spoken to Lord G.
  Sackville, remains unanswered, although Junius most probably made a
  mistake in that matter.</p>

  <p><i>The Six Gates of Troy</i> (Vol. viii., p. 288.).&mdash;The passage
  of Dares relative to the gates of Troy describes the deeds of Priam on
  succeeding to the throne:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Priamus ut Ilium venit, minime moram fecit, ampliora m&oelig;nia
  exstruxit, et civitatem munitissimam reddidit.... Regiam quoque
  ædificavit, et ibi Jovi Statori aram consecravit. Hectorem in Pæoniam
  misit, Ilio portas fecit, quarum hæc sunt nomina: Antenorea, Dardania,
  Ilia, Scæa, Thymbræa, Trojana. Deinde, postquam Ilium stabilitum vidit,
  tempus expectavit."&mdash;Chap. 4.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>It will be observed that these six names correspond with the six names
  in Shakspeare, except that Shakspeare, following some ignorant
  transcriber, substitutes <i>Chetas</i> for <i>Scæan</i>.</p>

  <p>The work, consisting of forty-four short chapters, which has come down
  to us under the title of <i>De Excidio Trojæ Historia</i>, by Dares
  Phrygius, is a pseudonymous production, which cannot be placed earlier
  than the fifth or sixth century. See the preface to the edition of
  Dederick, Bonnæ, 1835; or the article "Dares," by Dr. Schmitz, in Dr.
  Smith's <i>Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography</i>. Other writers
  spoke of <i>four</i> gates of Troy. (See Heyne, <i>Exc.</i> <span

  <p><i>Milton's Widow</i> (Vol. vii., p. 596.; Vol. viii., pp. 12. 134.
  200.).&mdash;Having noticed several Queries and Replies in your pages
  concerning the family of the poet Milton's third wife, I beg to give the
  following extracts from a pamphlet printed by Pullan of Chester so
  recently as 1851, entitled <i>Historical Facts connected with Nantwich
  and its Neighbourhood</i>:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"In that same year (1662), Milton was received at <i>Stoke Hall as the
  husband of Elizabeth Minshull</i>, <i>the grand-daughter of Geoffrey
  Minshull</i>."&mdash;P. 50. "Not far from the Hall, where Milton was
  <i>once a welcome visitor</i>, stands the Yew Tree House."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>There can be little doubt the author of the pamphlet referred to
  derived the information on which those statements were made from an
  <i>authentic source</i>; and if so, it seems pretty clear, the
  <i>Elizabeth Minshull</i> whom Milton married was <i>grand-daughter of
  Geoffrey Minshull of Stoke Hall</i>.</p>

  <p><i>Boom</i> (Vol. vii., p. 620.; Vol. viii., p. 183.).&mdash;The
  Bittern is not an uncommon bird in some parts of Wales, where it is very
  expressively called <i>Aderyn-y-Bwn</i> (the Boom-bird), or
  <i>Bwmp-y-Gors</i> (Boom of the Fen): the <i>w</i> is pronounced as
  double <i>o</i>.</p>

  <p class="author">W. R. D. S.</p>

  <p>"<i>Nugget</i>" <i>not an American Term</i> (Vol. vii.
  <i>passim</i>).&mdash;It is a mistake in our correspondent to suppose
  that the word "nugget" was used in California by American "diggers" to
  denominate a lump of gold. That word was never heard of in this country
  until after the discoveries in Australia. It is not used now in
  California, "lump" is the proper term; and when a miner accumulates a
  quantity, he boasts of his "pile," or rejoices in the possession of a
  "pocket full of rocks."</p>

  <p><i>Soke Mill</i> (Vol. viii., p. 272.).&mdash;Suit is not now enforced
  to the King's Mills in the manor of Wrexham, in the county of Denbigh,
  but the lessee of the manorial rights of the crown receives a payment at
  the rate of threepence per bushel for all the malt ground in hand-mills
  within the limits of the manor.</p>

  <p><i>Binometrical Verse</i> (Vol. viii., p. 292.).&mdash;This verse
  appeared in the <i>Athenæum</i> (Sept. 2, 1848, No. 1088, p. 883.), given
  by one correspondent as having been previously forwarded by another; but
  it does not appear to have been previously published.</p>

  <p><i>Watch-paper Inscription</i> (Vol. viii., p.
  316.).&mdash;Twenty-five years ago this inscription was set to music, and
  was popular in private circles. The melody was moderately good, and the
  "monitory pulse-like beating" of course was acted, perhaps over-acted, in
  the accompaniment. I am not sure it was printed, but the fingers of young
  ladies produced a great many copies. Your correspondent's version is
  quite accurate, and I think he must have heard it sung, as well as read
  it. <i>Segnius irritant</i>, &amp;c. is not true of what is read as
  opposed to what is heard with music.</p>

  <p class="author">M.</p>

  <p><i>Dotinchem</i> (Vol. viii., p. 151.).&mdash;Dotinchem appears to be
  the place which is called <i>Deutichem</i> in the map of the Netherlands
  and Belgian, published by the Useful Knowledge Society in 1843, and
  <i>Deutekom</i> in the map of the kingdom of the Netherlands, published
  by the same society in 1830. Moreri spells the name <i>Dotechem</i>,
  <i>Dotekom</i>, and <i>Dotekum</i>. It is situated on the Yssel,
  south-east of Doesburg.</p>

  <p><i>Reversible Names and Words</i> (Vol. viii., p. 244.).&mdash;I
  cannot call to mind any such <i>propria mascula</i>: but I think I can
  cast a doubt on your correspondent's crotchet. Surely our <i>civic</i>
  authorities (not even excepting the <i>Mayor</i>) are veritable males,
  though sometimes deserving the <i>sobriquet</i> of "old women."
  Surveyors, builders, carpenters, <!-- Page 376 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page376"></a>{376}</span>and bricklayers are the
  only persons who use the <i>level</i>. On board ship, it is the males who
  professionally attend at the <i>poop</i>. Our foreign-looking friend
  <i>rotator</i>, at once suggestive of certain celebrated personages in
  the lower house, is by termination masculine; and such members, in times
  of political probation, never fail to show themselves <i>evitative</i>
  rather than plucky.</p>

  <p>But some words are reversible in sense as well as in orthography. If a
  man <i>draw</i> "on" me, I should be to blame if at least I did not
  <i>ward</i> "off" the blow. Whom should we <i>repel</i> sooner than the
  <i>leper</i>? Who will <i>live</i> hereafter, if he be a doer of
  <i>evil</i>? We should always seek to <i>deliver</i> him who is being
  <i>reviled</i>. Even Shakspeare was aware of the fact, that it is a
  <i>God</i> who breeds magots in a dead <i>dog</i> (vide <i>Hamlet</i>).
  "Cum multis aliis." The art of composing palindromes is one, at least, as
  instructive as, and closely allied to, that of <i>de</i>-ciphering. If
  any one calls the compositions in question "trash," I cannot better
  answer than in palindrome, <i>Trash? even interpret Nineveh's art!</i>
  for the deciphering of the cuneiform character is both a respectable and
  a useful exercise of ingenuity. The English language, however, is not
  susceptible of any great amount of palindromic compositions. The Latin
  is, of all, the best adapted for that fancy. I append an inscription for
  a hospital, which is a paraphrase of a verse in the Psalms:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Acide me malo, sed non desola me, medica."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>I doubt whether such compositions should ever be characterised by the
  term <i>sotadic</i>. Sotadic verses were, I believe, restricted to
  indecent love-songs.</p>

  <p><i>Detached Church Towers</i> (Vol. vii. <i>passim</i>; Vol. viii., p.
  63.).&mdash;At Morpeth, in Northumberland, the old parish church stands
  on an eminence at the distance of a mile from the town. In the
  market-place is a square clock tower, the bells in which are used for
  ordinary parochial purposes.</p>

  <p>At Kirkoswald, in Cumberland, where the church stands low, the belfry
  has been erected on an adjoining hill.</p>

  <p><i>Bishop Ferrar</i> (Vol. viii., p. 103.).&mdash;Bishop Ferrar,
  martyred in Queen Mary's reign, was not of the same family with the
  Ferrers, Earl of Derby and Nottingham. Was your correspondent led to
  think so from the fact of the martyr having been originally a bishop of
  the Isle of Man?</p>

  <p>"<i>They shot him by the nine stone rig</i>" (Vol. viii., p.
  78.).&mdash;This fragmentary ballad is to be found in the <i>Border
  Minstrelsy</i>. It was contributed by R. Surtees of Mainsforth, co.
  Durham, and described by him as having been taken down from the
  recitation of Anne Douglas, an old woman who weeded in his garden. It is
  however most likely that it is altogether factitious, and Mr. Surtees'
  own production, Anne Douglas being a pure invention.</p>

  <p>The ballad called "The Fray of Haltwhistle," a portion of which, "How
  the Thirlwalls and the Ridleys a'," &amp;c., is interwoven with the text
  in the first canto of <i>Marmion</i>, is generally understood to have
  been composed by Mr. Surtees. He, however, succeeded in palming it upon
  Scott as a genuine old ballad; and states that he had it from the
  recitation of an ancient dame, mother of one of the miners of Alston
  Moor. Scott's taste for old legends and ballads was certainly not too
  discriminating, or he would never have swallowed "The Fray of
  Haltwhistle." Perhaps he suspected its authenticity, for he says of
  it:</p>

  <p><i>Punning Devices</i> (Vol. viii., p. 270.).&mdash;In the 4th volume

  Orchard Chamber in Sledwish Hall:</p>

  <p><i>Throwing Old Shoes for Luck</i> (Vol. vii., p. 411.).&mdash;There
  is an old rhyme still extant, which gives an early date to this singular
  custom:</p>

  <div class="poem">

      <p class="i2hg3">"When Britons bold,</p>

  <p><i>Ennui</i> (Vol. vii., p. 478.).&mdash;It is a curious fact that in
  <i>English</i>, properly so called, we have no word to express this
  certainly un-English sensation, which we are obliged to borrow from our
  friends across the channel. <i>They</i> repay themselves with
  "comfortable," which is quite as characteristically wanting in their
  vocabulary: so they lose nothing by the exchange. Were we disposed to
  supply the gaps in our language, by using our own native words (which is
  much to be desired), we might find a sufficient (and I believe the only)
  synonyme in the Bedfordshire folk-word <i>unked</i>: at any rate, it is
  near enough for us, for we neither require the word nor the feeling it is
  meant to designate.</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p class="author">"Bonn, July 19. 1852.</p>

  <p>"This light and pleasant Farina is one of the most excellent,
  nourishing, and restorative remedies, and supersedes, in many cases, all
  kinds of medicines. It is particularly useful in confined habit of body,
  as also diarrh&oelig;a, bowel complaints, affections of the kidneys and
  bladder, such as stone or gravel; inflammatory irritation and cramp of
  the urethra, cramp of the kidneys and bladder, strictures, and
  hemorrhoids. This really invaluable remedy is employed with the most
  satisfactory result, not only in bronchial and pulmonary complaints,
  where irritation and pain are to be removed, but also in pulmonary and
  bronchial consumption, in which it counteracts effectually the
  troublesome cough; and I am enabled with perfect truth to express the
  conviction that Du Barry's Revalenta Arabica is adapted to the cure of
  incipient hectic complaints and consumption.</p>

  already an enigma to the tyro, the most striking and characteristic
  features of the Coin are dissected and placed by themselves, so that the
